## 📖 Project Overview

**Vacation Planner** is a mobile app built with **Flutter** that helps users plan day-long vacations by generating detailed itineraries from 8 AM to 9 PM. Users can input a destination, specify preferences (cultural, adventure, food, relaxation), and receive personalized itineraries. The app leverages **Google Maps API** to fetch location data and calculate travel time, while **ChatGPT API** is used to generate the itinerary based on user preferences and locations.

This app is designed to simplify travel planning by automating much of the work, allowing users to relax and enjoy their vacation.
